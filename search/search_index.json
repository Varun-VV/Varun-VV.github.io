We'll use Virtual min for server management. Cloud provider is providing limited editions of Ubuntu and as of today, Virtual min installer works best with Ubuntu 16.04. However, Ubuntu 16.04 is quite old and not preferred because it comes with default version of PHP 7.0. For HSM, we need a min of PHP 7.2. So, we'll have to overcome this. Prepare for Virtual min Change password of the default user with command passwd Make sure to change the password of the root user also.. Switch to root with su and change password Add the default user to sudo group also with command user mod -aG sudo <user> Change the hostname with command hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname> Change it in the /etc/hosts file also. Make sure that the hostname are resolvable from external DNS Install Virtualmin After all the preparations are done.. time to install virtual min.

Upgrade Ubuntu We dont want to stay with version 16.04. We should atleast move to 18.04 or 20.04. Note: Move only to LTS versions. Prepare for Upgrade Upgrade over SSH may not be easy..
