There are about 18 flats in our apartment. Managing the expenses and finances of a small apartment is is also not simple. How and where do you track all your expenses and revenues ? There are some apratment management SaaS solutions but all of them charge $$. Some that are free - dont provide the key functionality like accounting and financial reporting. So, I decided to develop a small app for managing Our Apartment. My motto was to: - Make society management easy and hassle free - Make society management and accounting affordable and free for all Features Key features are: - Society Management and accounting solution for small and independent Apartments, Gated Communities and Co-operative Housing Societies. - Our Apartment is intuitive, user friendly and extremely easy to use - We provide premium features like accounting free for all ! - Manage member access through the admin control. Give access to create expenses to authorized members only and view financial reports to all members - Society Accounting: Automated Billing, Track all your Expenses, Generate all Financial Statements, Reports for Auditing. Get an overview of pending payments and projected balance. - Get notifications when payments are due and get reports via email. - Fully customizable: Customize the application according to your needs and preferences. Customization is very easy and intutive Architecture I started developing this around in 2017-18. At that point in time I was more comfortable with PHP (rather than JavaScript). So, I chose PHP based user management framework for developing this application. I am hosting this application on a Linux Virtual Machine.

However, Ubuntu 16.04 is quite old and not preferred because it comes with default version of PHP 7.0. For HSM, we need a min of PHP 7.2. So, we'll have to overcome this. Prepare for Virtual min Change password of the default user with command passwd Make sure to change the password of the root user also.. Switch to root with su and change password Add the default user to sudo group also with command user mod -aG sudo <user> Change the hostname with command hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname> Change it in the /etc/hosts file also.
