# Welcome !

I graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2005.

Every developer has a story..
And there is a story about every app... 

I'd like to share my stories, and my apps... 

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
